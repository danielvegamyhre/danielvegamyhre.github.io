For session 8 of the Eleuther AI ML Scalability & Performance reading group, I presented the Megatron-LM paper, which introduced tensor parallelism. 

My annotated versions of these papers can be found be found on my Github [here](https://github.com/danielvegamyhre/ml-scalability-and-performance-reading-group/tree/main/session_8).


Papers:
1. [Megatron-LM: Training Multi-Billion Parameter Language Models Using Model Parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08053)
