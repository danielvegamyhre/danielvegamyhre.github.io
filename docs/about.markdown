I'm currently a ML engineer at Meta and a part-time MS CS student a Georgia Tech. I also organize the EleutherAI ML scalability & performance research paper reading group, which you can find in the official EleutherAI Discord [here](https://www.eleuther.ai/community) if you're interested in joining (I also upload the recording to[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Eleuther_AI/playlists)). I've done various personal projects related to ML and distributed systems, which you can find on my [Github](https://github.com/danielvegamyhre).

The purpose of this site is for me to document what I'm learning or working on; up until recently I've mostly been learning independently while squirreled away at home, so I thought it would be fun to start sharing.
